""" Add Gaussian white noise to a time series.

Part of the accompanying code for the paper "Exploring localization in nonlinear oscillator systems through 
network-based predictions" by C. Geier and N. Hoffmann published in Chaos 35

Input time series. Gaussian white noise is defined by its mean and standard
deviation.
